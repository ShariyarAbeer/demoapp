          Setting is the time and place (or when and where) of the story. It’s a
          literary element of literature used in novels, short stories, plays,
          films, etc., and usually introduced during the exposition (beginning)
          of the story, along with the characters. The setting may also include
          the environment of the story, which can be made up of the physical
          location, climate, weather, or social and cultural surroundings. There
          are various ways that time and place indicate setting. Time can cover
          many areas, such as the character’s time of life, the time of day,
          time of year, time period such as the past, present, or future, etc.
          Place also covers a lot of areas, such as a certain building, room in
          a building, country, city, beach, in a mode of transport such as a
          car, bus, boat, indoors or out, etc. The setting of a story can change
          throughout the plot. The environment includes geographical location
          such as beach or mountains, the climate and weather, and the social or
          cultural aspects such as a school, theatre, meeting, club, etc.

          A simple example to understand setting is the Disney movie
          “Cinderella.” The setting starts out as
          <li>Time:</li> Cinderella as a young girl, long ago in the past
          <li>Place:</li> Cinderella’s home in a kingdom far away After her
          father dies, the time aspect of setting changes, skipping roughly ten
          years into the future. Understanding this change in time helps in
          keeping up with the story.
          <li>Time:</li> Cinderella as a young woman, long ago in the past
          <li>Place:</li> Cinderella’s home in a kingdom, in her bedroom and in
          the kitchen
        </p>
      </div>
